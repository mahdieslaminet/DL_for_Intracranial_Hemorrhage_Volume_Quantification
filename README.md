Enhancing Intracranial Hemorrhage Volume Quantification in Deep Learning Models through Advanced Image Preprocessing Techniques
This study explores the improvement of intracranial hemorrhage volume quantification in deep learning models by integrating advanced image preprocessing techniques. A dataset of head CT scan images from Kaggle was utilized, and optimal preprocessing methods were applied to enhance the input data quality for analysis. Various CNN-based deep learning models, including BHCNet, Hybrid CNN, Multilayer DenseNet-ResNet, CNN-LSTM Fusion Model, DL Solution, and CNN-Based Method, were employed for intracranial hemorrhage detection.

The study results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in accurately quantifying intracranial hemorrhage volumes. The CNN-based models demonstrated strong performance in detecting intracranial hemorrhages, with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values. Additional metrics such as positive and negative likelihood ratios, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and mAP further supported the models' performance, indicating their ability to differentiate between classes and provide an average precision score across all classes.

Furthermore, the study calculated 95% confidence intervals for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using the Clopper-Pearson method to ensure result reliability. The findings highlight the potential of advanced image preprocessing techniques and CNN-based deep learning models in enhancing intracranial hemorrhage volume quantification, thereby improving diagnostic capabilities in neuroimaging practice.

In the context of existing literature, studies by (Vrijhoef & Steuten, 2007), (Jena, 2023), and Denadai et al. (2017) have offered valuable insights into abstract writing, summarization techniques, and the conversion of abstract presentations to full manuscripts. The integration of advanced image preprocessing techniques and CNN-based deep learning models aligns with the trend of utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning in medical imaging applications, as demonstrated by recent studies by Hwang (2024) and (Pottier, 2023).

The successful application of these methodologies in enhancing intracranial hemorrhage volume quantification represents a significant advancement in medical image analysis, with implications for improving patient care outcomes and diagnostic processes in neuroimaging practice. Future re search directions may involve refining models, exploring additional validation methods, and extending these techniques to other medical imaging domains for enhanced clinical decision-making and patient care.

This study contributes to the expanding research on the application of deep learning models and advanced image preprocessing techniques in medical imaging, paving the way for improved diagnostic capabilities and patient outcomes in neuroimaging practice.
